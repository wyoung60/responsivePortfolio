# responsivePortfolio

## The Repository

Repository was created to build a webpage with bootstrap.  The webpage is responsive to changing screen sizes through use of bootstrap code.

## Lessons Learned

Bootstrap is a very useful tool to create a webpage with a good layout without an extensive css file.  It was a challenging to determine what each bootstrap class was doing but once understood, modification became much easier.
